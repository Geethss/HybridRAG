# Installation and Setup Guide

This document provides a brief overview of the installation and setup process for the PDF Assistant Chatbot Flask backend.

**For comprehensive, step-by-step, and up-to-date instructions, please refer to the main [README.md file](../README.md).**

The `README.md` file is maintained as the single source of truth for all setup procedures. It includes detailed guidance on:

-   Prerequisites
-   Cloning the Repository
-   Creating and Activating Virtual Environments (for Windows, macOS, and Linux)
-   Installing Dependencies
-   API Key Setup (Google Gemini, Pinecone, including index creation)
-   Environment Configuration (`.env` file setup and verification)
-   Running the Application Locally
-   Testing the API

Please use the main `README.md` for all installation and setup tasks to ensure you have the latest and most complete information. This approach helps us avoid redundancy and potential inconsistencies across documentation files.
