# Detailed Installation and Setup Guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijender883/EventBot
cd EventBot
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

Choose the commands appropriate for your operating system:

#### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# If script execution is disabled, run:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
# Then try activating again.
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

### 1. Create .env File

In the project root directory, copy the template file to create your local environment configuration file:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
On Windows, use `copy` if `cp` is not available:
```bash
copy .env.template .env
```

### 2. API Keys Setup

#### Get Google Gemini API Key

1.  **Visit Google AI Studio**: Navigate to [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and sign in with your Google account.
2.  **Create API Key**: Click "Create API Key" and follow the prompts (e.g., "Create API key in new project").
3.  **Secure Your Key**: Copy the generated API key (it typically starts with `AIzaSy...`). Store it securely and never commit it to version control.

#### Get Pinecone API Key and Create Index

1.  **Sign up for Pinecone**: Go to [https://www.pinecone.io/](https://www.pinecone.io/) and create a free account.
2.  **Get API Key**: After logging into the Pinecone console, navigate to the "API Keys" section and copy your API key (e.g., `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`).
3.  **Create a New Index** in the Pinecone console:
    *   **Index Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `pdf-assistant-index`). This exact name will be used in your `.env` file.
    *   **Dimensions**: Set to `768`. This is required for the `models/embedding-001` embedding model used by Gemini, which produces 768-dimensional vectors.
    *   **Metric**: Select `cosine` for similarity search.
    *   **Cloud Provider & Region**: Choose according to your preference (e.g., `AWS`, `us-east-1`). These details will also be needed for your `.env` file.
    *   Click "Create Index".

### 2. Configure .env File

Open the `.env` file with a text editor and fill in your actual API keys and Pinecone details:

```env
# Backend Configuration (FastAPI)
APP_ENV=development # Set to 'production' when deploying (e.g., for Uvicorn settings)
PORT=8000           # Default port for FastAPI/Uvicorn, can be changed

# API Keys (Replace with your actual keys)
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY_HERE"

# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="your_pinecone_index_name" # e.g., pdf-assistant-index
PINECONE_CLOUD="aws"                         # Your Pinecone cloud provider (e.g., aws, gcp)
PINECONE_REGION="us-east-1"                  # Your Pinecone index region (e.g., us-east-1)

# Optional: Logging Level for backend
LOG_LEVEL=INFO # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# Database URL (Critical for table storage and querying)
DATABASE_URL="mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@host:port/database" # Replace with your MySQL connection string

# Frontend Configuration
ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000" # URL for the backend API (default for FastAPI if PORT=8000)
# Optional: Logging Level for frontend (Streamlit does not use this directly from .env in the same way)
# STREAMLIT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```
**Important**:
- Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and configuration details.
- Ensure `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`, `PINECONE_CLOUD`, and `PINECONE_REGION` in `.env` precisely match your Pinecone index settings.
- The `ENDPOINT` variable is used by the Streamlit frontend to connect to the backend API. The default `http://localhost:8000` assumes the backend is running locally on the `PORT` specified for it. Adjust if your backend is configured for a different port (e.g., 5000 and `ENDPOINT="http://localhost:5000"`).
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control.

## üöÄ Running Locally

The application consists of two main parts: the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend. Both need to be running to use the application. You can use the `Makefile` for convenience.

### 1. Start the Backend Server

With your virtual environment activated and `.env` file configured:

Using Makefile:
```bash
make run-backend
```
Alternatively, run directly with Uvicorn (assuming your FastAPI app instance is named `app` in `app.py`):
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port ${PORT:-8000} --log-level ${LOG_LEVEL:-info}
# The ${PORT:-8000} will use the PORT from .env or default to 8000
# The ${LOG_LEVEL:-info} will use LOG_LEVEL from .env or default to info
```
The backend server will typically start on `http://localhost:8000` (or the `PORT` specified in `.env`).

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

Once the backend server is running:

1.  **Ensure `ENDPOINT` is set**: The Streamlit frontend needs the `ENDPOINT` environment variable to point to your running backend. If you followed the `.env` configuration step, this should be correctly set.
2.  **Run the frontend**:

    Using Makefile:
    ```bash
    make run-frontend
    ```
    Alternatively, run directly:
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/frontend/streamlit_app.py
    ```
The Streamlit application will typically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. You can now upload PDFs and chat with the assistant through this interface.

### 5. Set Environment Variables

In your Render service's dashboard, navigate to the "Environment" section. Add the following environment variables, using your actual values:

-   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: `Your_Google_Gemini_API_Key`
-   `PINECONE_API_KEY`: `Your_Pinecone_API_Key`
-   `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: `Your_Pinecone_index_name`
-   `PINECONE_CLOUD`: `Your_Pinecone_cloud_provider` (e.g., `aws`)
-   `PINECONE_REGION`: `Your_Pinecone_region` (e.g., `us-east-1`)
-   `DATABASE_URL`: `Your_MySQL_connection_string`
-   `APP_ENV`: `production` (Reinforces the setting in `start.sh`)
-   `LOG_LEVEL`: `info` (or `debug` for more verbose logging during troubleshooting)
-   `PORT`: Render will set this, but your `start.sh` uses it.
-   `WORKERS`: (Optional, if you made it configurable in `start.sh`, e.g., `2` or `4`)
-   `GUNICORN_TIMEOUT`: (Optional, e.g., `120` or `300` if you have long running requests)
-   `PYTHON_VERSION`: Optionally specify your Python version (e.g., `3.10.0`) if needed.

**Note on Frontend Deployment**: The above Render.com instructions are for deploying the FastAPI backend. Deploying the Streamlit frontend typically requires a separate service or a different setup. You might:
-   Deploy it as a separate Web Service on Render, configuring its start command as `streamlit run src/frontend/streamlit_app.py --server.port $PORT --server.headless true`. You'll also need to set the `ENDPOINT` environment variable for this frontend service to point to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-fastapi-backend.onrender.com`).
-   Use [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) for deploying the frontend, which is often simpler for Streamlit apps.
-   Adapt the `start.sh` script and potentially use a process manager like `supervisor` if you intend to run both backend and frontend from the same service instance (more complex).


<!-- ## üß™ Running Tests

*(This section outlines general steps. Specific test setup might vary.)*

This project should include automated tests to ensure reliability. Assuming `pytest` is the chosen test runner (a common choice for Python projects):

1.  **Activate Virtual Environment**: Ensure your `venv` is active.
2.  **Install Test Dependencies**: Development dependencies, including `pytest`, are listed in `requirements-dev.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
3.  **Run Tests**: Navigate to the project root directory and execute:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    Pytest will automatically discover and run tests (typically files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` in the `tests/` directory). Refer to the `README.md` for more details on testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1.  **Import Errors / Module Not Found**:
    *   **Virtual Environment**: Confirm your virtual environment is activated (`source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate`).
    *   **Dependencies**: Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   **PYTHONPATH**: Usually handled by the virtual environment. Avoid manual `PYTHONPATH` modifications unless you have a specific reason.

2.  **API Key Issues (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`)**:
    *   **`.env` File**: Ensure `.env` exists in the project root, is correctly named, and its content is accurate (no extra spaces/quotes around keys/values, ensure full connection string for `DATABASE_URL`).
    *   **Render Environment Variables**: Double-check that environment variables are correctly set in the Render dashboard and that the service was re-deployed after changes.

3.  **Pinecone Connection Problems**:
    *   **Configuration**: Double-check `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`, `PINECONE_CLOUD`, and `PINECONE_REGION` in `.env` against your Pinecone console.
    *   **Index Status**: Verify the index exists and is healthy in Pinecone.
    *   **Service Outages**: Check Pinecone's official status page.
    *   **Firewall/Network Issues (Render)**: Ensure Render's outbound IPs can reach Pinecone (usually not an issue for standard services).

4.  **MySQL Connection Problems (`DATABASE_URL`)**:
    *   **Connection String**: Verify the `DATABASE_URL` is correct (username, password, host, port, database name).
    *   **Database Accessibility**: Ensure the database is accessible from the environment where the app is running (e.g., from Render's IP addresses if using an external DB, or correct configuration for Render's own PostgreSQL/MySQL services).
    *   **User Privileges**: Check if the database user has the necessary permissions.

5.  **PDF Processing Fails (`/uploadpdf` errors)**:
    *   **File Validity**: Ensure the PDF is not corrupted.
    -   **Console Logs**: Check logs from your Uvicorn/Gunicorn process for detailed error messages. `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` can be helpful.
    *   **File Size/Type**: The application has checks for file size (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`) and type (`ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`) defined in the configuration and validated in `src/backend/utils/upload_pdf.py`.

6.  **`gunicorn` or `uvicorn` command not found (Render Deployment)**:
    *   Ensure `gunicorn` and `uvicorn` are in `requirements.txt`. If not, add them (`pip install gunicorn uvicorn`, then `pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and redeploy.

7.  **Timeout Issues on Render (especially `/uploadpdf`)**:
    *   The `start.sh` script uses `--timeout ${GUNICORN_TIMEOUT:-120}`. For very large PDFs or slow processing, this might need to be increased by setting `GUNICORN_TIMEOUT` in Render's environment variables. Be aware of Render's own request timeout limits (consult their documentation).
    *   For consistently long operations, consider implementing asynchronous background tasks (e.g., using Celery, FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`).

### Debug Mode (Local Development)

For more verbose error output locally:
1.  Set `APP_ENV=development` in your `.env` file.
2.  Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in your `.env` file for more detailed application logs.
3.  Run the app with Uvicorn: `uvicorn app:app --reload --port ${PORT:-8000} --log-level ${LOG_LEVEL:-debug}`. -->
